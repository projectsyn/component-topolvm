= TopoLVM

TopoLVM is a Commodore component to manage topolvm.

See the xref:references/parameters.adoc[parameters] reference for further details.

== Setup

* Create an LVM VolumeGroup named `vgssd` on the nodes you want.
* Add a label `syn.tools/topolvm=""` to the nodes which have the VolumeGroup.

== Maintenance

=== Extending Capacity

Topolvm (lvmd) checks a node ~10 minutes, so to extend the capacity of a node just extend its volumegroup.
